# What social problem are you working on?
    We are working on Mental Health Awareness

# Brief Description of your idea:
     With the protest for variou social justice issues and remote learning & work our mental health has been
    thrown out of whack and out of focus as we pay attention to our physical health.
    The Covid-19 Pandemic can potentially affect your physical health, but it has
    definitely affected everyoneâ€™s mental health. We wanted to remind everyone to
    take care of their mind as much as they do their bodies. It's the need of the hour
    to let positivity flow in. So our website aims at providing the people a zone out
    space from this pandemic and helps them to fill their mind with a surge of positive
    and enthusiastic thoughts thus turning their mindset into a positive one and
    helping them recover faster.
